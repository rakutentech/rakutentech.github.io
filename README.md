# [rakutentech.github.io](https://rakutentech.github.io/)

Website of Rakuten Open-source.

This app is written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). It requires to be compiled before being published. Keep reading to learn how to modify it.

## To install the development environment

The only prerequisite is to have Node.js installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After that, clone the repository with

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rakutentech/rakutentech.github.io.git
```

then move into the project folder and install the dependencies:

```shell
cd rakutentech.github.io
yarn install
```

now you are ready to run the development server with

```shell
cmd/start
```

this will download other dependencies, start a server and open a new page in the browser.
Now you can start your favorite editor and start changing the application. Every time you save the window in the browser will automatically refresh.

When you are happy with the result you can just commit your changes in the remote repository through a pull request. As soon as the changes are merged into the master branch they will be available online.

The main files that you may need to edit are in the src folder. If you want to modify the footer, for example, edit the file ViewFooter.elm. For the header: ViewHeader.elm, etc.

## Optimizer (optional step)

If you prefer to minify the Javascript file, remember to run this command before committing your modifications:

```shell
cmd/optimize
```

## Debug mode

If you are debugging the application you may compile it in debug mode using the command

```shell
cmd/start-debug
```

After running this command, remember to run either `cmd/start` or `cmd/optimize` before submitting your modifications to production.

## How the app works

The app automatically get the list of the repositories from Github. It also has a list of hard coded repositories in the file `Repos.elm`. Then it concatenated the two list together and show them in the page.
